**Download File ››››› [https://t.co/zDxg4AO0a2](https://t.co/zDxg4AO0a2)**


 
1. Go to the Graphisoft website and find the library update page for your region and language. For example, if you are using Archicad 10 INT (International) version, you can go to [this link](https://graphisoft.com/support/archicad/downloads/library_updates10/int).[^1^]
2. Download the compressed object library file for your operating system (Windows or Mac) and save it on your computer. The file name should be something like "Archicad Library 10.zip" or "Archicad Library 10.dmg".
3. Uncompress the file and locate the "Object Library 10.lcf" file inside. This is the library file that you need to install.
4. Replace the existing "Object Library 10.lcf" file with this one in your Archicad 10/ Archicad Library 10 folder. You can find this folder in the same location where you installed Archicad 10 on your computer.
5. Also replace the whole Lightworks 10 folder with the one from the downloaded file. This folder contains the materials and lighting effects for the library objects.
6. Launch Archicad 10 and open a new or existing project. Go to File > Libraries and Objects > Library Manager and make sure that the "Object Library 10.lcf" file is loaded. If not, click on Add and browse to the file location.
7. Click on OK and enjoy using the updated library in your Archicad 10 projects.

This library update contains corrections of reported bugs and inconsistencies, so it is recommended that you use it instead of the original library that came with Archicad 10. However, if you have modified any of the standard library objects and saved them back into the library, you will lose your customizations when you replace the library file. To avoid this, make sure you save your modified objects with a new name into your Project Library and use those in your project.
