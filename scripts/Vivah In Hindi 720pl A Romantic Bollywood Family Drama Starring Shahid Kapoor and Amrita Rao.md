The film begins with the introduction of Prem (Shahid Kapoor), a young and carefree boy who lives with his father Harishchandra (Anupam Kher), a wealthy businessman, and his aunt Chachiji (Seema Biswas), who takes care of him. Prem is not interested in studies or work, and spends his time with his friends. His father wants him to get married and settle down, but Prem is reluctant to do so.
 
On the other hand, Poonam (Amrita Rao) is an orphan who lives with her uncle Krishnakant (Alok Nath), a middle-class shopkeeper, and his family. Poonam is a sweet and simple girl who is loved by everyone. She is devoted to her uncle and aunt Rama (Lata Sabharwal), who treat her as their own daughter. Poonam has a younger cousin Rajni (Amrita Prakash), who is her best friend and confidante.
 
One day, Harishchandra visits Krishnakant's shop and sees Poonam there. He is impressed by her beauty and grace, and decides to propose her as a bride for Prem. He asks his friend Bhagatji (Manoj Joshi), a matchmaker, to arrange a meeting between the two families. Krishnakant agrees to the proposal, but Rama is hesitant as she feels that Poonam deserves a better match than Prem.
 
The meeting takes place at Krishnakant's house, where Prem and Poonam see each other for the first time. They feel an instant attraction towards each other, but do not express it. Prem is also charmed by Poonam's family and their simple lifestyle. He agrees to marry Poonam, and the engagement is fixed. The wedding date is set after six months, as Prem has to complete his studies in Delhi.
  
During the six months, Prem and Poonam communicate through phone calls and letters, and gradually fall in love with each other. They share their dreams, hopes, and fears, and support each other in their endeavors. Prem also becomes more responsible and mature, and starts working with his father. He also bonds with his cousin Sanjana (Samir Soni), who is like a brother to him.
 
Meanwhile, Poonam prepares for her wedding with the help of Rajni and Chhoti (Dinesh Lamba), a loyal servant of Krishnakant. She also faces some trouble from her neighbor Rahul (Mohnish Bahl), who is obsessed with her and tries to sabotage her marriage. However, Prem comes to her rescue and warns Rahul to stay away from her.
 
As the wedding day approaches, Prem and his family arrive at Krishnakant's house for the pre-wedding ceremonies. Prem and Poonam are overjoyed to see each other after a long time, and participate in the rituals with happiness and excitement. They also exchange gifts and vows of love and loyalty. The families also get along well and enjoy the festivities.
 
However, on the night before the wedding, a tragedy strikes. A fire breaks out in Krishnakant's house due to a short circuit, and Poonam gets trapped inside her room. Prem rushes to save her, but not before she suffers severe burns on her face and body. She is rushed to the hospital, where the doctors inform that she may not survive. Prem is devastated and blames himself for the accident.
