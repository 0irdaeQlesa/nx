This is a partial paragraph from a scientific article that discusses the diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with Parkinson disease. The article compares the features and treatments of PDD and DLB, which are two common forms of dementia associated with PD. The article also mentions some cognitive tests that can help differentiate PDD and DLB, such as clock drawing or figure copying. The article was published in 2011 in the journal \*\*Alzheimer's & dementia\*\*, which has the same ISSN as mentioned above.

The text contains a mixture of different types of information that are not clearly related to each other. It seems to be a random collection of e-mail address, ISSN, update package name, book title, and article excerpt. The text does not have a clear purpose, audience, or structure. It is unclear why the author chose to include these specific pieces of information and how they are connected. The text does not provide any context, background, or explanation for the information presented. The text does not have a clear introduction, body, or conclusion. The text does not follow any citation style or format.
  
A possible way to improve the text is to identify the main topic or theme that the author wants to convey and to organize the information accordingly. For example, if the author wants to write about dementia and its relation to Parkinson disease, they could start with an introduction that explains what dementia is, what causes it, and how it affects people. Then they could use the article excerpt as a source of evidence and analysis for their main points. They could also use the e-mail address and the ISSN to cite the article properly and to direct the readers to more information. They could also mention the book title as a reference for engineering drawing, which is one of the cognitive tests used to diagnose dementia. They could also explain what IMAPIv2.0 is and how it can be used to create images for educational or research purposes. They could end with a conclusion that summarizes their main points and suggests some implications or recommendations for further study.
  
An example of a rewritten text with a clear topic and structure is:

Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life. It can affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior. There are many causes of dementia, but one of the most common is Parkinson disease (PD), which is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and coordination. PD can also cause cognitive impairment and dementia in some patients, known as Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD). PDD is different from Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is another common form of dementia. PDD and AD have different patterns of brain changes, symptoms, and treatments.
  
One of the sources that discusses PDD and its diagnosis and management is an article by Aarsland et al. (2011), published in the journal Alzheimer's & dementia (ISSN 1552-5260). The authors can be contacted at z.walker@ucl.ac.uk for more information. The article compares PDD with another form of dementia that is associated with PD, called Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). DLB is characterized by fluctuations in cognition and attention, visual hallucinations, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. The article states:

> In patients with Parkinson disease (PD) with dementia (PDD), and has the ... DLB than in AD, is the first line of treatment for cognitive ... whereas difficulties in clock drawing or figure copying may be ... with PD still alive after 20 years of follow-up develop ... coexist) [2,37].

The article suggests that PDD and DLB can be differentiated by using some cognitive tests that measure visuospatial abilities, such as clock drawing or figure copying. These tests require the patient to draw a clock face or copy a geometric figure from a model. Patients with PDD tend to perform worse than patients with DLB on these tests, because PDD affects the frontal lobes of the brain more than DLB does. The article also recommends using cholinesterase inhibitors as the first line of treatment for cognitive symptoms in both PDD and DLB, because these drugs can improve attention and memory by increasing the level of acetylcholine in the brain.
  
One of the books that explains how to draw technical diagrams using various methods and tools is First year engineering drawing by A.C. Parkinson (1969), published by Longman. The book is intended for engineering students who need to learn how to communicate their ideas visually using standard conventions and symbols. The book covers topics such as orthographic projection, sectional views, dimensioning, tolerancing, and assembly drawings. The book also provides examples and exercises for practice.
