In this article, we will show you how to use a keygen software called Xentry Das Keymaker V2.0 to generate the keys for developer mode in Xentry/DAS. This software can be downloaded from various online sources, such as torrents[^2^] [^3^] or file sharing websites[^1^]. However, you should be careful about the legality and safety of these sources, as they may contain viruses or malware.
 
Before you use the keygen, you need to have Xentry/DAS installed on your computer. You can find different versions of Xentry/DAS on the internet, such as Xentry OpenShell 2021[^1^], which is a full image of Mercedes-Benz diagnosis tools that contains Xentry, DAS and the EWA suite of tools: EPC and WIS-ASRA. They are all pre-activated, but you still need to use the keygen to unlock developer mode.
 
To use the keygen, follow these steps:
 
1. Run the Xentry Das Keymaker V2.0.exe file on your computer.
2. Select the version of Xentry/DAS that you have installed from the drop-down menu.
3. Enter your hardware ID and LAN ID in the corresponding fields.
4. Click on Generate Key button.
5. Copy the generated key and paste it in the Xentry/DAS activation window.
6. Click on Save button and restart Xentry/DAS.

Now you should be able to access developer mode in Xentry/DAS and perform advanced functions on your Mercedes-Benz vehicle. However, you should be careful when using developer mode, as it can cause damage to your vehicle if you don't know what you are doing. Always consult a professional before making any changes to your vehicle's settings.
