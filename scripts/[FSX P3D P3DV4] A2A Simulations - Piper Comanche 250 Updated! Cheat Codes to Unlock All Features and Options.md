The Piper Comanche 250 is a four-seat, low-wing aircraft that was produced by Piper Aircraft from 1958 to 1972. It was designed to compete with the Beechcraft Bonanza and the Mooney M20, offering a spacious cabin, a retractable landing gear, and a powerful 250 hp engine. The Comanche 250 can cruise at over 170 knots and has a range of over 1,000 nautical miles.
 
A2A Simulations has recreated the Piper Comanche 250 with their signature Accu-Sim technology, which simulates every aspect of the aircraft's behavior, performance, and systems. Accu-Sim also adds realistic wear and tear effects, maintenance procedures, and pre-flight inspections. The add-on also features a detailed 3D model, high-resolution textures, custom sounds, realistic flight dynamics, and a variety of liveries.
 
The update for the Piper Comanche 250 adds support for Prepar3D v4 and v5, as well as some new features and enhancements. Some of the highlights are:
 
- A new option to enable or disable the Accu-Sim physics engine
- A new option to select between different GPS units, including the default FSX/P3D GPS, the Reality XP GNS 430/530, or the Flight1 GTN 650/750
- A new option to adjust the fuel selector sensitivity
- A new option to enable or disable the automatic mixture control
- Improved compatibility with TrackIR and VR devices
- Improved engine sounds and cockpit lighting
- Fixed issues with the fuel gauge, the propeller animation, the autopilot mode indicator, and the landing gear warning horn

In addition to these improvements, A2A Simulations has also added some cheat codes for those who want to spice up their flights with some extra challenges or surprises. These cheat codes can be activated by typing them in the radio panel while flying. Some of the cheat codes are:
